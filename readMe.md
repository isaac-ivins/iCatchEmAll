## The challenge:

---

iCatchEmAll PokeDex

---

Create Pokemon Trainers and "capture"/favorite pokemon from the Pokedex of your region.

Upon App Launch, users have the ability to create a new Pokemon Trainer or choose from one of the previously created Trainers.

After finishing the Onboarding Flow for creating a Pokemon Trainer users are shown:

- A PokeDex Tab where they can search for Pokemon in their region
- Caught Tab where they can view captured/favorited Pokemon
- Profile Details Tab where they can "logout" to pick or create a new Pokemon Trainer

The Pokemon listed on the PokeDex Tab, as well as the Caught Tab, have an accompanied Pokemon Details Modal available with more info when pressed

Data is stored in AsyncStorage so deleting the app off your device, or restarting the development client, may result in a loss of Pokemon Trainer data ( uh-oh! )
