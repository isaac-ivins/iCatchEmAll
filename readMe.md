## The goal:

Our team is excited to see your programming style, skill, approach, and creativity applied to a React Native application.

## Environment:

The application should run locally on the iOS Simulator and the Android Emulator. Assume the person reviewing your code is set up with the following:

- iOS on Mac

  -Android on Mac

Include the setup details necessary to run the application locally on either platform.

Livefront should not be responsible for getting its own API keys or access. If an API key and/or username/password is required, you can send that to us separately (it does not need to be stored in the repository)

## The challenge:

Using any publicly available API of your choosing (examples include Yelp, Flickr, New York Times, etc.), build a simple application with at least two screens. One screen should show a list of items from that API, while the second screen should show a detail view for one of those items. Use this as an opportunity to be creative and demonstrate your familiarity with native technologies.

Use of Typescript is required.

Tests are required. They may take any form deemed appropriate for the app (such as Jest or Mocha tests), but should demonstrate a basic understanding of testing a React native app.

Use of 3rd party libraries for common tasks (networking, etc.) is acceptable and should be clearly called out.

Use of open source code included directly in the project should be limited and clearly attributed with a link to the original source.

Code produced by generative AI is prohibited.

The app must be placed in a public repo on a site like GitHub or Bitbucket.

The app must be able to be pulled down from your provided repo and built with the env details and instructions listed above.
